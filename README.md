Open your browser to http://localhost:5000


🛠️ Feature Enhancements
✅ Basic Improvements

🤖 Smarter Chatbot

Add natural language understanding (e.g. using OpenAI or a keyword parser) and update feature

Let users say things like:

“I want to see Prof. Smith’s hours”
“Update my office hours on Wednesday to 1–3PM”


🔒 Authentication

1. Add Professor Identity
Add the professor's email, send a code to "submit" or "delete" the office hours
Only allow submissions if verified
2. retrive info via DB instead of csv

🖼️ UI Enhancements

Use chat bubbles and avatars for bot/user

Add loading animation when backend is processing

🌐 publish it online so professors and students can access it from the web.

✅ ChatGPT suggestion:

If you want simple + reliable → use Render.

If you want super quick demo → use Replit.

If you want AI community exposure → use Hugging Face Spaces.
